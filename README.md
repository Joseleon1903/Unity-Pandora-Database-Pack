# Pandora Mobile Database
Repo for code that I usually end up writing over again and again when working on multiple different kinds of games so 
I decided to create a custom Unity package to make life easier.

To install this project as a [Git dependency](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html) using the Unity Package Manager,
add the following line to your project's `manifest.json`:

```
"unity.pandora.database.mobile": "https://github.com/Joseleon1903/Unity-Pandora-Database-Pack.git"
```
